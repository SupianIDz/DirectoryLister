# DirectoryLister

DirectoryLister is a simple PHP application that displays the contents of a folder in an easy-to-navigate web listing.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SupianIDz/DirectoryLister.git lister
```

1. Point your web server’s root directory to the `public` folder inside the cloned project.

2. Put the files or folders you want to display inside the `storage` folder.

3. Open your browser and access your web server’s root URL — you will see the contents of the storage folder displayed automatically.

## Notes

- Make sure the storage folder is accessible by the web server.

- Adjust the folder permissions so the application can read its contents properly.
